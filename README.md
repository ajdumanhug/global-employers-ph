# Global Employers for PH Cybersecurity Professionals 🇵🇭

A crowdsourced directory of **non-Filipino-owned companies** that:
- Operate in the Philippines 🇵🇭 or hire remote Filipino professionals
- Offer **fair, competitive salaries and benefits** to Filipino workers—especially in **cybersecurity** 💼🛡️

> Helping Filipino cybersecurity professionals find global companies that value skills—not just location.

---

## 🌏 Purpose

This project was inspired by [a blog post](https://moto.h4ck3r.sh/why-global-companies-should-pay-global-salaries/) that explores why global companies should pay global salaries—not local rates—when hiring remote workers. It highlights the imbalance in compensation practices and advocates for a fairer, talent-first approach to remote hiring.

Cybersecurity professionals in the Philippines often deliver the same high-quality results as their global peers but are frequently underpaid simply because of where they live. This project aims to:

- Highlight employers who **fairly compensate** Filipino cybersecurity talent
- Promote remote opportunities for skilled Cybersecurity professionals
- Serve as a reference for job seekers, recruiters, and community advocates in the cybersecurity field

To be listed, a company must meet at least **two** of the following:

- Operates globally and hires in the Philippines
- Is **not Filipino-owned**
- Pays Filipino cybersecurity professionals close to global market standards
- Has a reputation for fair compensation or inclusive hiring practices
